        <h4>Rules:</h4>
        <p>In this online rock-paper-scissors game, players engage in a classic duel against a computer opponent, testing their strategic prowess and luck. The rules are simple: players must click on their chosen symbol - rock, paper, or scissors - to initiate a round. The computer then randomly selects its own move. The outcome of the round is determined by the familiar rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.</p>
        <p>Each round played against the computer records the outcomeâ€”whether the player won or lost. It tallies a cumulative score of wins and losses over multiple rounds. This streamlined approach offers a focused experience, allowing players to gauge their performance in each round.</p>
